# atlas-headphones
## Project Objective
- In this project, you will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that you learned previously.

## Project Description
- Atlas Headphones is a project inspired by a real-world design challenge, where we were tasked with turning a Figma desgin into a fully responsive, accessible web page.
- We implement a design from scratch using a given figma page. Once the design is implemented in both HTML and CSS, it'll have to be accessibile and responsive.
